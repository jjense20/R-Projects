# NBA Salary Prediction

Trying to predict salaries for players within the next season using a mulitple linear regression model. This will utilize **web-scraping** to first filter salary data then create a regression model to find the variables that are most important in determining salary contracts. 

## Introduction



## Files

The project is based on a similar one done by [koki](https://www.kaggle.com/koki25ando) but is instead using current salary data. The *csv files* that were scraped will be included in this folder along with the scraping script. An **rmd** as well as **r script** file of the final project is included here, but do check out my Kaggle page for a more convenient reading experience. 

## Requirements

There are no pre-requisites for viewing the given *.ipynb*, *.R*, and *.rmd* files, however if you wish to download any of the files to work with them I would suggest using [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) or [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) for working with notebooks. 

Here is some sample code for one of the plots created.

```r
